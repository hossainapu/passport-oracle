# Change Log

## node-oracledb v1.12.2 (21 Dec 2016)

- Fix memory allocation with Oracle 11g client libraries when querying CLOBs using `fetchAsString` and `fetchInfo`.

## node-oracledb v1.12.1 Development (16 Dec 2016)

- Added support for fetching CLOBs as Strings, using `fetchAsString` and `fetchInfo`.

- Added `BIND_INOUT` support for temporary LOBs.

## node-oracledb v1.12.0 Development (3 Dec 2016)

- Significantly enhanced LOB support:
   - Added `BIND_IN` support for DML
   - Added `BIND_IN`, `BIND_OUT`, `BIND_INOUT` support for PL/SQL
   - Added a `connection.createLob()` method to create temporary LOBs
   - Added a `lob.close()` method
   - Made enhancements to allow binding String or Buffer data as `STRING` or `BUFFER` to LOB database types
   - Writeable LOB Streams now conclude with a 'close' event

- Added a connection pool 'ping' feature controlled with
  `oracledb.poolPingInterval` and a corresponding `createPool()`
  option. This validates pooled connections when they are returned
  from a `getConnection()` call.  Values are

     - zero: always ping for every pooled `getConnection()`
     - negative: never ping
     - positive: time in seconds the connection must be idle in the pool before `getConnection()` does a ping.  Default is 60 seconds

  The setting is a no-op when node-oracledb is built with Oracle
  Database 12.2 client libraries, where a new, lower-level OCI feature
  provides an always-on, lightweight connection check.

- Upgraded NAN dependency from 2.3 to 2.4.

- Stated compatibility is now for Node.js 0.12, 4, 6 and 7.

- Fixed return value of the DATE type bound as `BIND_INOUT`.

- Fixed passing NULL values bound as `BIND_INOUT` for several data types.

- Fixed compilation warnings with newer Node.js versions due to V8 deprecations.

- Fixed some Windows and OS X compilation warnings.

- Linted JavaScript files, standardizing code, example and test files.

- Updated various examples and created new ones.

- Updated README.md and api.md introductory examples, based on a patch proposed by [Leigh Schrandt](https://github.com/stealthybox).

- Updated README.md thanks to [Nick Heiner](https://github.com/NickHeiner).

- Updated documentation links to point to the Oracle Database 12.2 documentation.

- Made some internal changes to the DPI layer to avoid name space collisions
  and fix session tagging.  These are not visible / exposed through
  node-oracledb.

## node-oracledb v1.11.0 (19 Aug 2016)

- Added a connection pool cache feature allowing pools to have aliases and be more easily used.

- Improved the bootstrap error message when the node-oracledb binary cannot be loaded.

- Fixed memory leaks with `DATE` and `TIMESTAMP` bind values.

- Fixed external authentication which broke in 1.10.

- Fixed metadata `scale` and `precision` values on AIX.

- Made an internal change to replace `std::string.data()` with `std::string.c_str()`.

- Made an internal change to remove an unused parameter from the `NJS_SET_EXCEPTION` macro.

## node-oracledb v1.10.1 (21 Jul 2016)

- Fixed a bug that prevented a null value being passed from JavaScript into an IN OUT bind.

- Fixed a memory leak introduced in 1.10 with REF CURSORs.

- Fixed a memory leak in error handling paths when using REF CURSORs.

- Made an internal change for queries selecting unsupported column types allowing them to report an error earlier.

- Made an internal change to use `std::string&` for string lengths.

- Fixed a compilation warning on Windows.

- Added a mocha configuration file for the test suite.

## node-oracledb v1.10.0 (8 Jul 2016)

- Enhanced query and REF CURSOR metadata is available when a new
  `oracledb.extendedMetaData` or `execute()` option `extendedMetaData`
  property is `true`. (Leonardo Olmi).

- Fixed an issue preventing the garbage collector cleaning up when a
  query with LOBs is executed but LOB data isn't actually streamed.

- Fixed a bug where an error event could have been emitted on a
  QueryStream instance prior to the underlying ResultSet having been
  closed.  This would cause problems if the user tried to close the
  connection in the error event handler as the ResultSet could have
  prevented it.

- Fixed a bug where the public `close()` method was invoked on the
  ResultSet instance that underlies the QueryStream instance if an
  error occurred during a call to `getRows()`. The public method would
  have thrown an error had the QueryStream instance been created from
  a ResultSet instance via the `toQueryStream()` method. Now the
  underlying C++ layer's `close()` method is invoked directly.

- Updated `Pool._logStats()` to throw an error instead of printing to
  the console if the pool is not valid.

- Report an error earlier when a named bind object is used in a
  bind-by-position context.  A new error NJS-044 is returned.
  Previously errors like ORA-06502 were given.

- Added GitHub Issue and Pull Request templates.

- Some enhancements were made to the underlying DPI data access layer.
  **These are not exposed to node-oracledb users.**

   - Allow <code>SYSDBA</code> connections
   - Allow session tagging
   - Allow the character set and national character set to be specified via parameters to the DPI layer.
   - Support heterogeneous pools (in addition to existing homogeneous pools)

## node-oracledb v1.9.3 (24 May 2016)

## node-oracledb v1.9.1 (18 May 2016)

- Upgraded to NAN 2.3 for Node 6 support.

- Added a persistent reference to JavaScript objects during Async
  operations to prevent crashes due to premature garbage collection.

  premature garbage collection.

- Fixed memory leaks when using ResultSets.

- Fixed memory leak with the Pool queue timer map.

- Fixed memory release logic when querying LOBs and an error occurs.

- Improved some null pointer checking.

- Altered some node-oracledb NJS-xyz error message text for consistency.

- Call `pause()` internally when closing a query Stream with `_close()`.

- Fixed a symbol redefinition warning for `DATA_BLOB` when compiling on Windows.

- The test suite is no longer installed with `npm install oracledb`.
  The tests remain available in GitHub.

## node-oracledb v1.9.0 Development (19 Apr 2016)

- Added Promise support. All asynchronous functions can now return
  promises. By default the standard Promise library is used for Node
  0.12, 4 and 5.  This can be overridden.

- Added a `toQueryStream()` method for ResultSets, letting REF CURSORS
  be transformed into Readable Streams.

- Added an experimental query Stream `_close()` method.  It allows query
  streams to be closed without needing to fetch all the data.  It is
  not for production use.

- Added aliases `pool.close()` and `connection.close()` for
  `pool.terminate()` and `connection.release()` respectively.

- Some method parameter validation checks, such as the number or types
  of parameters, will now throw errors synchronously instead of
  returning errors via the callback.

- Removed an extra call to `getRows()` made by `queryStream()` at
  end-of-fetch.

- Some random crashes caused by connections being garbage collected
  while still in use should no longer occur.

- Regularized NJS error message capitalization.

## node-oracledb v1.8.0 (24 Mar 2016)

- Added `connection.queryStream()` for returning query results using a
  Node Readable Stream (Sagie Gur-Ari).

- Connection strings requesting DRCP server can now only be used with
  a node-oracledb connection pool.  They will give *ORA-56609* when
  used with `oracledb.getConnection()`.

- Set the internal driver name to `node-oracledb : 1.8.0`.  This is
  visible to DBAs, for example in `V$SESSION_CONNECT_INFO`.

- Added up-time to pool queue statistics.

- Fixed creation of Windows debug builds.

- Bumped NAN dependency to NAN 2.2.

- Added .editorconfig file (Sagie Gur-Ari).

  `pool._logStats()` to display pool and queue statistics.  Note: these may
  change in future.

- Added "bind by position" syntax for PL/SQL Index-by array binds (Dieter Oberkofler).

- Allowed node-oracledb class instances to be tested with 'instanceof'.

- Fixed some bind issues when bind values are not set by the database.
